## Teaching Experience 

**Introduction to Quantitative Methods for Monitoring and Evaluation (BST 216)** \
*Teaching Fellow* - Harvard University \
Spring 2020 & Spring 2021 
- Monitoring and evaluation is concerned with assessing the quality of a program as measured against action plans, and evaluating its overall impact. This course addresses the quantitative or statistical aspects of monitoring and evaluation: what to measure, how to measure, how to analyze and how to make inference for the next steps of program implementation.

**Introduction to Statistical Methods (BST 201)** \
*Teaching Fellow* - Harvard University \
Fall 2019 & Fall 2020
- Covers basic statistical techniques that are important for analyzing data arising from epidemiology, environmental health and biomedical and other public health-related research. Major topics include descriptive statistics, elements of probability, introduction to estimation and hypothesis testing, nonparametric methods, techniques for categorical data, regression analysis, analysis of variance, and elements of study design. 

**Linear Algebra & Differential Equations (MATH 240)** \
*Teaching Assistant* - University of Pennsylvania \
Fall 2016 
- Linear algebra: vectors, matrices, systems of linear equations, vector spaces, subspaces, spans, bases, and dimension, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors, maxtrix exponentials. Ordinary differential equations: higher-order homogeneous and inhomogeneous ODEs and linear systems of ODEs, phase plane analysis, non-linear systems.
