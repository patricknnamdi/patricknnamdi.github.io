I'm a current third year biostatistics PhD Student at Harvard University studying **statistical machine learning** and **digital phenotyping** within the [Onnela Lab](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/). 

My research focuses on learning behavioral patterns and treatment strategies that improve patient recovery after a clinical or surgical intervention. The methods I seek to develop leverage the use digital phenotyping data that has been collected from smartphones (using [Beiwe](https://www.beiwe.org/)) in order to derive metrics that capture a patient’s physical activity, mobility, and pain response. Furthermore, I’m generally interested in learning statistical methods that help make sense of high-dimensional data commonly seen in application of remote patient monitoring systems.

My current goals include: 
1. Constructing offline reinforcement learning methods to estimate recovery strategies for surgical patients that are interpretable and quantify decision-making uncertainty
1. Predicting post-operative recovery patterns in temporally dense, longitudinal data. 

For my undergraduate career, I had the pleasure of working for [Dr. Micheal Levy](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p6363868), whose research focuses on developing epidemiological and computational methods for controlling the spread infectious diseases via insect vectors.
