I'm a current third year biostatistics PhD Student at Harvard University studying digital phenotyping and machine learning. 

My research focuses on learning **behavioral patterns and treatment strategies** that improve **patient recovery** after a clinical or surgical intervention. The methods I seek to develop leverage the use **digital phenotyping data** that has been collected from **smartphones** as part of an ongoing collaboration with the Department of Neurosurgery at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in order to derive metrics that capture a patient’s physical activity, mobility, and pain response.

My current goals include: 
1. Constructing **offline reinforcement learning methods** to estimate recovery strategies for surgical patients that are interpretable and quantify decision-making uncertainty
1. Predicting **post-operative recovery patterns** in temporally dense, longitudinal data using **latent state space models**.
