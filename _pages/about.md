I'm a current third year biostatistics PhD Student at Harvard University studying **statistical machine learning** and **digital phenotyping** under the co-supervision of [Dr. Jukka-Pekka Onnela](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/onnela-lab/) and [Dr. Junwei Lu](https://junwei-lu.github.io/). My Ph.D. is currently supported by the Harvard Prize Fellowship and the T32 Cancer Training Grant.

My research focuses on learning behavioral patterns and treatment strategies that improve patient recovery after a clinical or surgical intervention using reinforcement learning and latent state space models. The methods I seek to develop leverage the use digital phenotyping data that has been collected from smartphones (using [Beiwe](https://www.beiwe.org/)) in order to derive metrics that capture a patient’s physical activity, mobility, and clinical outcome. Furthermore, I’m generally interested in developing statistical methods that help make sense of data commonly seen in applications of remote patient monitoring systems.

For my undergraduate career, I had the pleasure of working for [Dr. Micheal Levy](https://www.med.upenn.edu/apps/faculty/index.php/g275/p6363868), whose research focuses on developing epidemiological and computational methods for controlling the spread infectious diseases via insect vectors.
